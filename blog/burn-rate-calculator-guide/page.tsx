          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">What Is Burn Rate?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed my-4">Burn rate is the rate at which a company spends its cash reserves before generating positive cash flow. Gross Burn Rate equals total monthly operating expenses. Net Burn Rate equals total monthly expenses minus total monthly revenue. Runway in months equals cash on hand divided by net burn rate.</p>
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">How to Calculate Burn Rate</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed my-4">Pull the last 3-6 months of financial data including total cash spent and total revenue each month. Calculate monthly averages to smooth out one-time expenses. Example: if average expenses are $88,333 and average revenue is $18,333, net burn rate is $70,000/month. With $500,000 cash on hand, runway is 7.1 months.</p>
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Burn Rate Benchmarks by Stage</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed my-4">Pre-seed: $10K-$30K monthly burn, 18+ months runway. Seed: $30K-$100K burn, 18-24 months. Series A: $100K-$300K burn, 18-24 months. Series B: $300K-$800K burn, 18-24 months. Growth: $500K-$2M+ burn, 12-18 months. Rule of thumb: always maintain at least 12 months of runway. Start fundraising with 6-9 months remaining.</p>
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Managing and Reducing Burn Rate</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed my-4">Quick wins: audit subscriptions and cancel unused software, renegotiate contracts, defer non-essential spending 90 days, review headcount ROI. Strategic reductions: optimize compensation mix with more equity and less cash, go remote, automate before hiring, focus marketing on proven channels.</p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed my-4">Revenue acceleration to reduce NET burn: test price increases of 20%, offer annual contracts for prepayment, reduce churn, upsell existing customers, offer consulting revenue as bridge income.</p>
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Burn Rate Red Flags</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed my-4">Watch for burn rate increasing faster than revenue, less than 6 months runway (emergency mode), wildly varying month-to-month burn indicating poor controls, declining gross margins masked by revenue growth, and hidden burn from accrued expenses not reflected in current figures.</p>
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">The Fractional CFO Role in Burn Rate Management</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed my-4">Monthly burn rate review with gross and net calculations, comparison to plan, runway projection under scenarios.
